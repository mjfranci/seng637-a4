# Introduction
This lab includes two parts: Mutation Testing and GUI Testing. Through part one, we learn how to inject mutation faults in a Java code-base using a mutation testing tool and how to interpret the reported mutation scores and use that knowledge to design new test cases to improve the overall quality of the test suite. In part two, we focus on the most common way of GUI test automation, record and replay. We learn how to use Selenium try to compare it with Sikulix, an alternative.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 
We analyzed 10 mutants from our original Range test suite, choosing one surviving and one killed mutant from each SUT method that we tested.

#### Range.expandToInclude(Range range, double value)
- Mutation: Changed condition of greater than to greater than or equal to
    - Status: Survived
    - Analysis: This mutation survived because the value that was being tested shouldn't be equal to the condition
- Mutation: Negated conditional
    - Status: Killed
    - Analysis: This mutation was killed because the condition is how the code constructs the return value. Changiing the condition changes the return value, causint he test to fail

#### Range.contains(double value)
- Mutation: Incremented (a++) double local variable number 1
    - Status: Survived
    - Analysis: This mutation survived because the value that was being tested was well within the condition that an increment of 1 would not affect the outcome
- Mutation: Substitued 1 with 0
    - Status: Killed
    - Analysis: This mutation was killed because the method returns only a 1 or a 0. If the return value is changed, then the test will always fail

#### Range.constrain(double value)
- Mutation: Decremented (a--) double local variable number 1
    - Status: Survived
    - Analysis: This mutation survived because the value that was being tested was well outside the condition that a decrement of 1 would not affect the outcome
- Mutation: Replaced comparison check with true
    - Status: Killed
    - Analysis: This mutation was killed because the condition is how the code constructs the return value. Changing the condition changes the return value, causing the test to fail

#### Range.intersects(double b0, double b1)
- Mutation: Changed the condition of greater than or equal to into the condition of greater than
    - Status: Survived
    - Analysis: This mutation survived becuase the value that was being tested was outside the condition being tested. Changing the condition doesn't change the boolean outcome
- Mutation: Negated conditional
    - Status: Killed
    - Analysis: This mutation was killed because the condition is how the return value is constructed

#### Range.shift(Range base, double delta)
- Mutation: Incremented (a++) double local variable number 1
    - Status: Survived
    - Analysis: This mutation survived because a condition to be tested later is already false, so changing the value does not change the condition
- Mutation: Substitued 0 with 1
    - Status: Killed
    - Analysis: This mutation was killed because it is a condition to be tested later. Changing the condition changes the return value

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class
The PIT summary reports for the example tests and our original Range and DataUtilities test suites can be found at the following links:

[Example PIT HTML file](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfranci/seng637-a4/main/PIT_Summary_Example_Tests/index.html)

[Range PIT HTML file](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfranci/seng637-a4/main/PIT_Summary_Range/index.html)

[DataUtilities PIT HTML file](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfranci/seng637-a4/main/PIT_Summary_DataUtilities/index.html)

The mutation score for our test classes were as follows:
- Range: 460 / 1259 (37 %)
- DataUtilities: 311 / 687 (45 %)

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes
The mutation score is very similar to the line coverage. The similar scores make sense, as we were not instructed to write a test class that had robust line coverage. We were only instructed to have robust line coverage for specific methods.

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy
There were very few equivalent mutants that we could find. The ones we found were mostly mutations applied to a conditional statement. Because the values involved in the condition were already assumed to be outside of the conditional range, changing the condition didn't have an effect on the outcome. Still, they had an effect on the accuracy score by a marginal amount.

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites
A very simple way of increasing the mutation score of our test suites is to improve the line coverage. We did this in our test suite by adding tests for the methods that we previously had not tested in assignments 2 and 3. In some cases, it is very difficult to improve the line coverage, such as for private methods, or for equivalent mutants. Regardless, we were successful in improving the mutation score of our test suites by increasing the line coverage.

To improve the line coverage of our test suites, we looked for each line of code that returned a value, and wrote a test to reach that return statement. This exact process is not recommended, as it can cause the coder to look to fit the test to the code. Proper testing procedures and practices should be followed when testing code.

See the links below for the PIT summary reports that were generated after we added tests to our test suites.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing
We need mutation testing so that we can analyze the quality of our test code. It is a way to check that our test code is robust enough to find defects in the SUT.

Some advantages of mutation testing:
- It provides robust error detection
- It can discover ambiguities within the SUT

Some disadvantages of mutation testing:
- It is time consuming
- It cannot be used for Black Box testing
- Equivalent mutations do not affect the output of the program

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints


# how did you test each functionaity with different test data


# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix
Our group was not actually able to get SikuliX working on any of our computers, but we were able to create scripts with it and get an idea of its potential capabilities.

Selenium Advantages:
- Can interact directly with web elements (html tags, attributes, css selectors, etc)
- Very fast and easy to create tests with the record feature
- Well supported across multiple web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc)
- Large user community, so more online support, tutorials, and plugins 
- Better user interface 
- Better documentation

Selenium Disadvantages:
- No desktop support. Primarily used for web automation
- No image recognition

Sikulix Advantages:
- Image recognition allows you to interact with elements that you may not be able to directly access the underlying code 
- Desktop support: can be used to test or automate a broader range of GUIs

Sikulix Disadvantages:
- Creating automation scripts is slower and takes more effort because you need to give it screenshots of each element
- Limited ability to automate web tasks
- More primitive user interface
- Limited documentation

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
We tried to divide the work evenly between group members, especially for the GUI testing. Each team member attempted to run mutation testing on our code, and shared our findings with each other.

We summarize our responsibilites for GUI testing here:
- Jean-Charl Pretorius
    - Verify Successful Login
    - Verify Login with Invalid Credentials
    - Verify Login with Blank Credentials

- Michael Le
    - Verify Adding Items to Cart
    - Verify Cart Functionality
    - Verify Checkout Process

- Michael Francis
    - Verify Search with Valid Keyword
    - Verify Search with Invalid Keyword
    - Verify Logout Functionality

- Samuel Sofela
    - Verify Sorting of Products by Price in Ascending Order
    - Verify Sorting of Products by Price in Descending Order
    - Verify Quick View Functionality

- Sam Rainbow
    - Add an Address 
    - Add then Edit an Address
    - Single viewed product present in recent viewed product list
    - Multiple products viewed present in recent viewed product list

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
- Pitest was not working properly at first because a library it is dependent on needed to be moved from the JRE system library to the class path
- We were unable to get Selenium to work for Home Depot, so we switched to Shop Smart Canada
- We were unable to get Sikulix to work on any of our computers
- Mutation testing helps us to make robust testing suites

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
This lab seemed much easier than previous labs, save for more troubleshooting to get the tools working properly. If we were able to get the tools to work, it ran smooth and we learned a lot about how mutations can help us see the quality of our code and our tests. Sikulix did not work at all, however, and we would suggest to examine the requirements regarding this tool for future lab groups.
