# Introduction
This lab includes two parts: Mutation Testing and GUI Testing. Through part one, we learn how to inject mutation faults in a Java code-base using a mutation testing tool and how to interpret the reported mutation scores and use that knowledge to design new test cases to improve the overall quality of the test suite. In part two, we focus on the most common way of GUI test automation, record and replay. We learn how to use Selenium try to compare it with Sikulix, an alternative.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 
We analyzed 10 mutants from our original Range test suite, choosing one surviving and one killed mutant from each SUT method that we tested.

#### Range.expandToInclude(Range range, double value)
- Mutation: Changed condition of greater than to greater than or equal to
    - Status: Survived
    - Analysis: This mutation survived because the value that was being tested shouldn't be equal to the condition
- Mutation: Negated conditional
    - Status: Killed
    - Analysis: This mutation was killed because the condition is how the code constructs the return value. Changiing the condition changes the return value, causint he test to fail

#### Range.contains(double value)
- Mutation: Incremented (a++) double local variable number 1
    - Status: Survived
    - Analysis: This mutation survived because the value that was being tested was well within the condition that an increment of 1 would not affect the outcome
- Mutation: Substitued 1 with 0
    - Status: Killed
    - Analysis: This mutation was killed because the method returns only a 1 or a 0. If the return value is changed, then the test will always fail

#### Range.constrain(double value)
- Mutation: Decremented (a--) double local variable number 1
    - Status: Survived
    - Analysis: This mutation survived because the value that was being tested was well outside the condition that a decrement of 1 would not affect the outcome
- Mutation: Replaced comparison check with true
    - Status: Killed
    - Analysis: This mutation was killed because the condition is how the code constructs the return value. Changing the condition changes the return value, causing the test to fail

#### Range.intersects(double b0, double b1)
- Mutation: Changed the condition of greater than or equal to into the condition of greater than
    - Status: Survived
    - Analysis: This mutation survived becuase the value that was being tested was outside the condition being tested. Changing the condition doesn't change the boolean outcome
- Mutation: Negated conditional
    - Status: Killed
    - Analysis: This mutation was killed because the condition is how the return value is constructed

#### Range.shift(Range base, double delta)
- Mutation: Incremented (a++) double local variable number 1
    - Status: Survived
    - Analysis: This mutation survived because a condition to be tested later is already false, so changing the value does not change the condition
- Mutation: Substitued 0 with 1
    - Status: Killed
    - Analysis: This mutation was killed because it is a condition to be tested later. Changing the condition changes the return value

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class
The PIT summary reports for the example tests and our original Range and DataUtilities test suites can be found at the following links:

[Example PIT HTML file](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfranci/seng637-a4/main/PIT_Summary_Example_Tests/index.html)

[Range PIT HTML file](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfranci/seng637-a4/main/PIT_Summary_Range/index.html)

[DataUtilities PIT HTML file](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfranci/seng637-a4/main/PIT_Summary_DataUtilities/index.html)

The mutation score for our test classes were as follows:
- Range: 460 / 1259 (37 %)
- DataUtilities: 311 / 687 (45 %)

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes
The mutation score is very similar to the line coverage. The similar scores make sense, as we were not instructed to write a test class that had robust line coverage. We were only instructed to have robust line coverage for specific methods.

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy
There were very few equivalent mutants that we could find. The ones we found were mostly mutations applied to a conditional statement. Because the values involved in the condition were already assumed to be outside of the conditional range, changing the condition didn't have an effect on the outcome. Still, they had an effect on the accuracy score by a marginal amount.

To detect theses equivalent mutants, we could test the proximity of the conditional statement to a return statement, but this does not guarantee the detection of other equivalent mutants. It does not gaurantee that all equivalent mutants are of this type in a different SUT either.

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites
A very simple way of increasing the mutation score of our test suites is to improve the line coverage. We did this in our test suite by adding tests for the methods that we previously had not tested in assignments 2 and 3. In some cases, it is very difficult to improve the line coverage, such as for private methods, or for equivalent mutants. Regardless, we were successful in improving the mutation score of our test suites by increasing the line coverage.

To improve the line coverage of our test suites, we looked for each line of code that returned a value, and wrote a test to reach that return statement. This exact process is not recommended, as it can cause the coder to look to fit the test to the code. Proper testing procedures and practices should be followed when testing code.

See the links below for the PIT summary reports that were generated after we added tests to our test suites.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing
We need mutation testing so that we can analyze the quality of our test code. It is a way to check that our test code is robust enough to find defects in the SUT.

Some advantages of mutation testing:
- It provides robust error detection
- It can discover ambiguities within the SUT

Some disadvantages of mutation testing:
- It is time consuming
- It cannot be used for Black Box testing
- Equivalent mutations do not affect the output of the program

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints
In Selenium IDE, "checkpoints" are validation points or verification steps that are used to verify the expected behavior of a web application during test execution. Checkpoints are used to validate that the application is functioning correctly by comparing the actual values or states of elements on the webpage against the expected values. Assertions are one type of checkpoint that can be used in Selenium IDE. In Selenium IDE, "assert" commands are used to verify the expected behavior of the web application during test execution. The "assert" commands allow you to check whether specific conditions are true or false and provide feedback on whether the test passed or failed based on the assertion results. Adding assertions in our Selenium IDE tests were crucial to completing this part of the assignment, as AssertText and AssertValue were commonly used to verify that the test had been redirected to the correct page, if the correct sorting method had been used, or if the cart had the correct total value after an item was added or removed. Asserts enabled us to specify a target and value for an element on a page at different points in the test, allowing us to set additional conditions and verification for a passed test. If the assertion condition is true (i.e., the actual value matches the expected value), the test continues execution without any issues. If the assertion condition is false (i.e., the actual value does not match the expected value), the test There are also various "assert" commands for different types of verifications, like "assertText," "assertTitle," "assertElementVisible,” depending on the validation you want to perform, which makes asserts a powerful feature of Selenium IDE.

Checkpoints are crucial in testing because they help ensure that the application behaves as expected. They help make test cases more robust and reliable, and make it easier to identify the cause of test failures as they happen.

# How did you test each functionaity with different test data
Each test functionality was tested using different scenarios and values when it was applicable. For example, the login functionality in the Shop Smart Canada website was tested using valid, invalid, or blank credentials. By verifying that login works for valid credentials and does not work for invalid or blank credentials, we become more confident in the security and robustness of our application. Similarly, the search functionality was tested using valid and invalid keywords. For example, searching “laptop” in the Shop Smart Canada page returned over 200 product links in the results. Conversely, searching for “xyzabc” returned 0 results as expected since there is no product with this name. The purchase functionality was tested by adding and removing different quantities of items to and from the shopping cart. As this is occurring, we are checking that the total quantity and price of the shopping cart matches the expected values. Another example is the sort functionality - we are experimenting with different sorting techniques for price in our tests. One test ensures that using the “Price: Low to High” sorting of items on a page means the product prices are ascending. The other last ensures that using the “Price: High to Low” sorting of items means the product prices are descending.

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix
Our group was not actually able to get SikuliX working on any of our computers, but we were able to create scripts with it and get an idea of its potential capabilities.

Selenium Advantages:
- Can interact directly with web elements (html tags, attributes, css selectors, etc)
- Very fast and easy to create tests with the record feature
- Well supported across multiple web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc)
- Large user community, so more online support, tutorials, and plugins 
- Better user interface 
- Better documentation

Selenium Disadvantages:
- No desktop support. Primarily used for web automation
- No image recognition

Sikulix Advantages:
- Image recognition allows you to interact with elements that you may not be able to directly access the underlying code 
- Desktop support: can be used to test or automate a broader range of GUIs

Sikulix Disadvantages:
- Creating automation scripts is slower and takes more effort because you need to give it screenshots of each element
- Limited ability to automate web tasks
- More primitive user interface
- Limited documentation

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
We tried to divide the work evenly between group members, especially for the GUI testing. Each team member attempted to run mutation testing on our code, and shared our findings with each other.

    - UI Test Cases for "Login" Functionality
    - UI Test Cases for "Purchase" Functionality

- Michael Le
    - UI Test Cases for "Search" Functionality
    - UI Test Cases for "Sort" Functionality

- Michael Francis
    - UI Test Cases for "Logout" Functionality
    - UI Test Cases for "Contact Customer Service" Functionality

- Samuel Sofela
    - UI Test Cases for "View FAQ" Functionality
    - UI Test Cases for "View Blog" Functionality

- Sam Rainbow
    - UI Test Cases for “Shipping Addresses”
    - UI Test Cases of “Recent Viewed Products”

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
- Pitest was not working properly at first because a library it is dependent on needed to be moved from the JRE system library to the class path
- We were unable to get Selenium to work for Home Depot, so we switched to Shop Smart Canada
- We were unable to get Sikulix to work on any of our computers
- Mutation testing helps us to make robust testing suites

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
This lab seemed much easier than previous labs, save for more troubleshooting to get the tools working properly. If we were able to get the tools to work, it ran smooth and we learned a lot about how mutations can help us see the quality of our code and our tests. Sikulix did not work at all, however, and we would suggest to examine the requirements regarding this tool for future lab groups.
