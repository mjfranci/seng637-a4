Our Mutation Testing code is all contained in the folder JFreeChart_Lab4b. The folder can be imported as a file system to Eclipse and run without further imports. **IMPORTANT** The test suite that we used for this assignment are RangeTestSuiteImproved.java and DataUtilitiesTestSuiteImproved.Java

The five PIT_xxx_xxx folders contain the HTML code generated from our Mutation testing. The reports can be viewed by clicking the links within our seng-a4-6.md final report file.
